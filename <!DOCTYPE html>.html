    Dear Kyle,
  </p>
  <p>
    Words cannot fully express how I feel when I'm around you. You bring so much joy and brightness to my life, and I wanted to take a moment to let you know that you are truly special to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have an incredible personality that lights up any room you enter, and your smile is infectious. Every conversation with you leaves me with butterflies in my stomach, and I find myself thinking about you constantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your kindness, intelligence, and sense of humor never fail to amaze me. I feel incredibly lucky to know you, and I cherish every moment we spend together.
  </p>
  <p class="love-note">
    I like you more than words can say.
  </p>
  <p class="signature">With all my heart,<br>Justin</p>
